# 🐍 Python Mastery Bootcamp
## From Zero to L3/L4 Google Engineer Level

A comprehensive, modern Python course focusing on type safety, production-ready code, and human-AI collaboration.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

This bootcamp transforms beginners into professional Python developers through:
- **36 weeks** of structured learning
- **Type-safe code** with MyPy --strict from day 1
- **Modern tooling** with Poetry, Ruff, and pytest
- **Real projects** that are portfolio-ready
- **Human-AI collaboration** preparation

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

1. **Learn by Typing** - No copy-paste, build muscle memory
2. **Production Standards** - Every line of code is production-ready
3. **Type Safety First** - Full type hints on everything
4. **Modern Tools** - Poetry, MyPy, Ruff from the start
5. **Real Projects** - Build actual applications, not toy examples

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Computer running Ubuntu/Linux (or WSL2 on Windows)
- 40 hours/week availability (or adjust timeline proportionally)
- Basic computer literacy
- Motivation to type a lot of code!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/py-course.git
cd py-course

# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Verify setup
poetry run python --version
poetry run mypy --version
poetry run ruff --version
```
