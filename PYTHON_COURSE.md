## 📖 Course Style Guide

### Practical vs Academic Balance

We adopt a **"Practical-First with Academic Rigor"** approach:

- Start with real-world use case
- Explain theory when it matters
- Academic depth on demand (bonus sections)
- Always return to practical application

### Code Examples

- Every example is production-ready
- No "toy" code without real purpose
- Comments explain "why" not "what"
- Type annotations on everything

### Learning Progression

1. **See It**: Read the concept
2. **Type It**: Manually type all code
3. **Break It**: Intentionally cause errors
4. **Fix It**: Resolve with understanding
5. **Test It**: Write comprehensive tests
6. **Ship It**: Deploy or package
